# 3D Shape Calculations

![3D Shapes](https://your-image-link-here.com)

Welcome to the 3D Shape Calculations module! If you're interested in contributing to this project, please feel free to get in touch. Keep in mind that this is primarily a passion project and a testing ground rather than a production-ready module.

This module provides a set of functions for calculating the volume, curved surface area, and total surface area of various 3D shapes.

## Description

### Volume: Calculate the volume for 3D shapes
- `calculate_volume_cube`
- `calculate_volume_cuboid`
- `calculate_volume_cylinder`
- `calculate_volume_cone`
- `calculate_volume_sphere`
- `calculate_volume_hemisphere`

### Curved Surface Area: Calculate the curved surface area for 3D shapes
- `calculate_curved_area_cube`
- `calculate_curved_area_cuboid`
- `calculate_curved_area_cylinder`
- `calculate_curved_area_cone`
- `calculate_curved_area_sphere`
- `calculate_curved_area_hemisphere`

### Surface Area: Calculate the total surface area of shapes and 3D shapes

#### Shapes:
- `calculate_area_square`
- `calculate_area_rectangle`
- `calculate_area_circle`
- `calculate_area_triangle`

#### 3D Shapes:
- `calculate_area_cube`
- `calculate_area_cuboid`
- `calculate_area_cylinder`
- `calculate_area_cone`
- `calculate_area_sphere`
- `calculate_area_hemisphere`

## Installation

### Single Install
The easiest way to install all the required packages is via conda. You can find instructions on how to install conda on your system [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html).

To create a new environment that contains all the required packages with the correct versions, run the following code:

```bash
conda env create -f install/environment.yml
```

This command will create a new environment named `environment_env`, which can be used to run this repository.

> NOTE: The `environment.yml` file is located in the `install/` directory [here](install/environment.yml).

### Multiple Installs
Another option is to install each package separately, either with conda or pip.

Using conda:
```bash
conda install <PACKAGE>=<VERSION>
```

Using pip:
```bash
pip install <PACKAGE>==<VERSION>
```

> NOTE: Be sure to use the correct versions, which are listed [here](#packages).
